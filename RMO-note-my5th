Audio Basics
	What is Sound?
		Vibrations traveling through the air.
		
	Analog vs Digital
		All sound you hear is analog audio.
		Digital audio is data visually displayed on a screen.

	Waveform
		Shows waves of air pressure.
		line swings up to a peak = higher pressure
		Zero line is the pressure of the air at rest.
		Line swings down to a through = lower pressure

		If a waveform's peaks and throughs are perfectly in phase.
		They reinforce each other, resulting in a waveform that has higher amplitude that neither individual waveform.

		If the peaks and throughs are peftectly out of phase.
		They cancel each other out

	Noise cancellation
		Uses in every day life:
			Noise cancelling headphones
			Car industry

		
	Frequency
		The rate at which a sound wave vibrates.
			Measured in cycles per second hertz. (Hz)

	Do you know the range of human hearing?
		20Hz - 20KHz

	Sampling Rate
		Measured used when digitally capturing a sound (Hz)
			More points collected per second = more accurate sound
			
			Low sampling rate
				distorts the original signal
			
			High sampling rate
				accurately reproduces original signal

	Decibles (dB)
		Unit to measure the intensity of a sound
		
		Sound Type	decibel level
		total silence	0dB
		whisper		16dB
		normal convo	60dB
		lawnmower	90dB
		car horn	110dB
		jet engine	120dB

	Bit Depth
		Dynamic range of an audio file (dB)
		More bits = wider range of volume

		bit depth	quality level	amplitude	dynamic
		8 bit		telephone	256		48dB
		16 bit		CD		65,536		96dB
		24 bit		DVD		16,777,216	144dB
		32bit		Best		4,294,967,296	192dB

	Channels
		Mono
		Stereo

		One or more individual audio segments often combied with a single piece of content.
			Every piece of audio has at least one audio channel.

	Peaking/Clipping
		If you try to push an audio signal that is too loud through your computer or audio recorder, your audio
		will peak.

		To Fix:
			Lower your microphone's input volume
			Move your microphone further from the audio source.

	Audio Recording Techniques
		Use a quality microphone.
		Add narration in a controlled environment/limit background noise.
		Monitor the sound throughout the entire recording.
		Use subjects with consistent volume.

	Eadweard Muybridge
		Hired to study whether all four feet of a horse were off the ground at the same time while trotting
		and galloping.

		Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; 
		gallop with all feet off the ground.


		Photographed a horse named "Occident" in fast motion using a series of 12 stereoscopic cameras at the 
		Palo Alto farm in California.

		Cameras were arranged along a track and each camera's shutter was controlled by a tripwire which was 
		triggered by the horse's hooves.

		Copied the images in the form of silhouettes onto a disc to be viewd in a machine he had invented. called
		a zoopraxiscope.

		Considered the first movie projector.

	Video Frames
		Video is made up of still images in sequence to produce the illusion of motion.

	Frame Rate
		Number of still pictures used to generate one second of video.

		24 fps
			standard/cinematic view
			more blur
		
		30 fps (29.97)
			American tv broadcast

		48 or 60fps
			real time = less motion blur, crisper images
			HD slow motion

	Scan Lines
		Interlaced
		Odd then even horizontal scan lines of each frame are drawn alternately.

	Scanning Lines
		Progressive
		Lines of each frame are drawn in sequence
