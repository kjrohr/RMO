Projct Details
	What is the project?
		You will work on planning, shooting, recording, editing, and publishing a video to the web.
		
	Why Video?
		How time do you spend watching video online per day?
		Video is fast becoming a critical part of the web:
			Online video is a $5.75 billion industry
			204.2 million people (78.6% of US internet users) watch online video monthly.
			Amount of time users spend watching online video has grown 38.5% in the past 2 years
		
	Minimum Requirements
		Fairly minimal and open; you decide on the scope and topic
		Feedback from your peets and instructor will be given throughout the process in order to refine and produce a professional piece.
	
			Must be at least 3 minutes in length,
			Must include a voiceover/narration,
			Must include background music,
			And must include 2 animations created in After Effects.

	Topics
		The topic for the video is up to you; here are a few possibilities:
			Demo Reel
			Tutorial
			Project overview
			How to video
			Public Service Announcement
		Be creative. Do something that may feel out of your element.

	Process
		Week 1: Planning Scripting
		Week 2: Shooting and Recording Audio
		Week 3: Editing and Motion Graphics
		Week 4: Final Editing and Publication


Why Optimize?
	Why Optimize?
		Most consumers wait about 3 seconds for a website to load on a desktop or a laptop.
		and about 5 seconds on their mobile device.
		Amazon found that if their pages slow down by 1 second, they lose $1.6 billion a year.
		Google uses page load time as a factor in their ranking algorithm.

	"Image optimzation is both an art and science: an art 
	because there is no one definitive answer for how best to compress 
	an individual image, and a science because there are many well
	developed techniques and algorithms that can significantly
	reduce the size of an image." - developers.google.com

	First Steps
		Eliminate unnecessary image resources
		Leverage CSS3 effects where possible
		USe web fonts instead of encoding text in images

	Lossless Compression
		Retains all of the data of the original file as it's converted
		to a smaller file size
	
		Algorithms restore all compressed information, creating a 
		duplicate of the source file.

	Run-Length Encoding
		Sequences that have the same data/value occuring in many
		consecutive data elements are stored as a single data value
		and count.

		This is most useful on relatively simple graphics images
		such as icons, line drawings, and animations.

		It is not recommended for use with files that don't
		have many runs as it could potentially double the file size.


	Lossy Compression
		Some of teh source file's information is discarded to conserve
		Space.
	
		When decompressed, this information is reconstructed through
		algorithms, usually resulting in some loss of sound quality
		or image detail.

		Generally, the higher the resolution of the compressing file,
		the less the degradation.

	Chroma Subsampling
		Encoding images by implementing less resolution for chroma information.

			Luma = brightness
			Chroma = color
		
		It is used in both analog and digital video encoding schemes
		and certain types of jpeg encoding

		The human is is more sensitive to variations in brightness
		than color

	Raster Graphics
		Grid of Pixels
		Larger the image = larger file size
		Increased # of pixels = increased resolutions
		Larger than a vector files.
		Difficult to modify without loss of information

	Vector Graphics
		Generated using drawing or illustration programs.
		
		Composed of mathematically - defined geometric shapes
		lines, objects and fills.

		Infinite scalability with smaller file size

	SVGS
		Infinite resolution and very small file sizes
		
		Stores images as a series of coordinates that form shapes
		rather than pixel data.
			XML can be embed directly on the page, or as an external resource.
		supported in all modern browsers.

	
	Image Formats
		Max Colors
			GIF = 256
			JPG = 16.6 million
			PNG = > 16.8 million
		Transperancy
			GIF = yes
			JPG = no
			PNG = yes
		Compression Method
			GIF = lossless
			JPG = Lossy
			PNG = lossless

	When to Use...
		JPG
			Photos, images with gradients
		GIF
			images with text, simple shapes and crisp edges
			blocks of solid color or animation
		PNG
			images with transparency, flat/solid colors
			simple shapes and crisp edges

	The Future?
		FLIF - Free Lossless Image Format
		
			35% smaller than typical PNG files
			37% smaller than lossless JPEG 2000 compression
			
			Works well on any kind of image, so the user does
			not need to try different algorithms and parameters
	
			Supports progressive decoding
			Royalty-free

	Color Depth
		Number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel
		in a bitmapped image
	
		Higher color depth gives a broader range of distinct colors

		Color Depth - # of colors - color mode - palette
		1	      2		    indexed	 yes
		4	      16	    indexed	 yes
		8	      256	    indexed	 yes
		24	      16,772,216    true color   yes
