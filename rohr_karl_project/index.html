    <li class="her">isn’t that what you’re into? the girls from dating sites?</li>
    <li class="her">i mean, i know that’s what you were into while we were together.</li>

    <li class="him">Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you.</li>

    <li class="her">karl, i’m not dead. what the hell is wrong with YOU?</li>
    <li class="her">look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot. but it really is me karl, i can prove it to you.</li>
    <li class="her">remember our first date? when we went to that really cute movie theater and saw the corpse bride on the night it came out?</li>

    <li class="him">Anyone could have found that on my Facebook Timeline.</li>
    <li class="him">Knock this shit off and delete this account before I call the police</li>

    <li class="her">calling the police on a dead girl? that’s a riot.</li>
    <li class="her">and anyway, after the movie you took me to steak n’ shake.</li>
    <li class="her">you told me my eyes were the brightest blue you’d ever seen</li>
    <li class="her">you kissed me that night, too. it was cute because you were all nervous about it.</li>
    <li class="her">remember that, karl?</li>

    <li class="him">...</li>

    <li class="her">or. OR.</li>
    <li class="her">on our second date, which i KNOW you didn’t post on Facebook…</li>
    <li class="her">we walked around downtown and found that really old movie rental place, remember?</li>
    <li class="her">we ended up finding a copy of the original Crow and rented it because it’s your favorite.</li>
    <li class="her">we cuddled in the basement at my place on the futon but i fell asleep because that movie is seriously boring.</li>
    <li class="her">you kept waking me up by poking my sides</li>
    <li class="her">and tickling me</li>

    <li class="him">No, Lindsay is dead.</li>

    <li class="her">karl. be reasonable.</li>
    <li class="her">what about your class ring?</li>
    <li class="her">i know you still have it.</li>
    <li class="her">that is, unless you gave it to your new girlfriend.</li>
    <li class="her">i gave it back to you, after all.</li>
    <li class="her">that day that i caught you with the girl from tinder at OUR table at steak n shake?</li>
    <li class="her">how long was it that you had been seeing her for again?</li>
    <li class="her">i’m pretty sure she said it was your one month anniversary that night???</li>

    <li class="him">Lindsay… please…</li>

    <li class="her">please what, karl? </li>
    <li class="her">i begged you please when you were walking out the door to go see her that night</li>
    <li class="her">i begged you please to tell me the truth when i walked in on you two in the place together</li>
    <li class="her">did you comply to my “please”? </li>

    <li class="him">No, but...</li>

    <li class="her">but what, karl!?!</li>

    <li class="him">But I didn’t think you’d kill yourself!</li>
    <li class="him">I didn’t think it was like that!</li>

    <li class="her">so all of those times i said i couldn’t live without you, you thought i was joking?</li>

    <li class="him">Not joking, but exaggerating maybe…</li>

    <li class="her">so what about all of those times that YOU told ME “till death do us part, baby”?</li>
    <li class="her">was that “exaggerating”?</li>

    <li class="him">Lindsay, be reasonable…</li>

    <li class="her">okay karl.</li>
    <li class="her">i still love you enough to be reasonable</li>
    <li class="her">and i mean, death has already done us part, right?</li>
    <li class="her">we need to talk, in person.</li>
